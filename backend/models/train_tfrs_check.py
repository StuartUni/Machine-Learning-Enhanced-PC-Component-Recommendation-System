Description:
This script checks if a TensorFlow Recommenders (TFRS) model already exists.
Features:
- If no model exists (or retraining is forced), exports ratings from the SQLite database
- Triggers training of a new TFRS model and saves it to disk
- Supports manual retraining via command-line execution
